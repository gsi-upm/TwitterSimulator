Twitter simulator based on MASON.
<hr>
<p>A simulation of the famous social network: Twitter. The behaviour of any user can be modelled to anaylsed the response to external events, such as footbal matches or music concerts.

<p>This model supports the use of non-real time, it is that the simulation has control of how much represents a single step in the simulation and then a concrete period of time and real-life events during the simulation can be scheduled.
